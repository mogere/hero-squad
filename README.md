# Project Hero Squad
### Description
This project is an automation of the caesar Cipher. It takes in a text from the 
user and using a key that the user also inputs, converts the text into a cipher 
text by moving each character in the input string (excluding special characters 
and space) by the number of spaces indicated in the key
